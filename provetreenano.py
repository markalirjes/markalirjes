#Well, let's go to prove it
p = 2
#price is const in all algoritm
benefitrate = supply * p
#productleft is same for scale time
Diversionrate = productleft / 100
#qc is fixed cost and same for all year 
costrate = Diversionrate + qc
#nanoproduct is a Several products that are collected in one product
nanorate = 1 / nanoproduct
#In a developed economy
y = benefitrate - costrate 
y = supply * p - Diversionrate + qc
#in nano scale economy
y1 = benefitrate1 - costrate1
y1 = nanorate * supply * p - 0 + qc
y1 > y
